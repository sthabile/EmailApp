Since the file creates a heirachy, i thought it was best to use a Tree-like structure to represent it. I also used Dictionaries because they give that ability to link data of different types. 
My solution constist of one class Office.cs that represents an office, which consists of an OfficeName, Amount,Parent Office and its Descendants. The office class implements a few methods. You can add descendants to an Office, retrieve a descendant of an office, Find the Net profit of an office.

Question 1
For this question, the algorithm is as follows:
Read in the data from file
Sort and store using the Office class
Read in the name of Office to get desired Net Profit
Calculate and print the desired Net Profit

Question 2
For this question, the algorithm is as follows:
Read in the data from file
Sort and store using the Office class
Compare the Net Profit of all offices and find the largest
Print the Name and the Profit
